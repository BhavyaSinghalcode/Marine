        <h2>Shipwrecks</h2>
        <p>
            The ocean floor is a treasure trove of history, with countless shipwrecks lying silently beneath the waves. These wrecks are not only relics of the past but also habitats for marine life.
        </p>
        <h3>The Story of the Titanic</h3>
        <p>
            The RMS Titanic, a luxury British passenger liner, tragically sank on its maiden voyage in 1912 after hitting an iceberg in the North Atlantic Ocean. Of the 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, over 1,500 lost their lives, making it one of the deadliest commercial peacetime maritime disasters in modern history.
        </p>
        <p>
            The wreck of the Titanic was discovered in 1985 at a depth of about 12,500 feet. Today, it remains a haunting reminder of human ambition and the power of nature.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over time, the Titanic has become a habitat for unique marine species. Rusticles, icicle-shaped formations of rust, are formed by iron-eating bacteria and provide insights into the shipwreck's decomposition.
        </p>
        <h3>Other Notable Shipwrecks</h3>
        <p>
            The ocean is home to many famous shipwrecks. The Spanish Galleons, lost in storms during the age of exploration, carried treasures that are still being discovered today. The USS Arizona, sunk during the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, serves as a war memorial in Hawaii.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the Baltic Sea, the Vasa, a 17th-century Swedish warship, was recovered almost intact due to the low salinity of the water, which slowed its decay. It now rests in a museum in Stockholm, offering a glimpse into naval history.

                    <h4>Vasa Shipwreck</h4>
                    <p>The Vasa, a 17th-century Swedish warship, sank on its maiden voyage in 1628. Remarkably preserved in the cold, brackish waters of the Baltic Sea, the ship was recovered almost intact in 1961. The Vasa provides historians and archaeologists with invaluable insights into 17th-century shipbuilding techniques and naval warfare. It is now displayed in the Vasa Museum in Stockholm, Sweden, where visitors can marvel at its intricate carvings and craftsmanship. The ship's ornate design reflects the ambition of King Gustavus Adolphus, who commissioned the Vasa to demonstrate Sweden's naval power. Tragically, the ship's instability and insufficient ballast led to its capsizing just minutes into its journey. Despite its failure, the Vasa remains an iconic symbol of maritime history.</p>
